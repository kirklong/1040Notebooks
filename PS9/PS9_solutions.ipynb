    "\n",
    "The big bang theory predicts that background light was freely emitted as black-body radiation when the universe cooled to around 3,000 K 380,000 years after its beginning. Why did the universe have to wait this long? In the beginning the big bang predicts that the universe would be filled with a very hot and dense soup of subatomic particle plasma, which was opaque to light (optically thick). As the universe expanded it cooled, and eventually reached a tipping point after a few hundred thousand years where it was cool enough that the first atoms (mostly H) could form &mdash; these atoms were basically transparent when compared with the earlier subatomic plasma soup, so all of the light that was bouncing around in the early universe was let out in an instant, to freely travel across cosmic time and space. Because space has expanded a great deal since the big bang this radiation has been redshifted into the microwave portion of the EM spectrum, hence we call it the cosmic *microwave* background (CMB). Because it was emitted at the moment the universe became mostly transparent, this radiation marks the farthest back in time and space we can possibly see. The big bang theory predicted the properties of the cosmic microwave background before it was observed, thus its observation is one of the fundamental underpinnings of this theory and why we think it is the best explanation for how our universe was formed. \n",
