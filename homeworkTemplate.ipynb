    "# ASTR 1040 Jupyter Notebook Homework Template\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a template file you can use to do your homeworks in. I recommend copying this each time you start a homework. The first cell (below) contains lots of helpful constants you may need to use throughout the semester. Make sure to run it each time before you start working! \n",
    "\n",
    "For reference, all of the `astropy` constants as well as examples can be found [here](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/constants/index.html). Likewise all of the units and their names / how to access them can be found [here](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/index.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "To create a variable with units you need to multiply by the corresponding unit class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "d = 1 * units.au\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then convert unitful quantities to other units by calling the `to` method and passing the desired end unit class: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "d_m = d.to(units.m)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a ratio of quanities where all the units should cancel out, you can obtain the dimensionles number using the `dimesionless_unscaled` method. For example writing:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "d_m/d\n",
    "``` \n",
    "yields $1.4959787\\times 10^{11} \\rm{\\frac{m}{AU}}$, but doing:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "(d_m/d).to(units.dimensionless_unscaled)\n",
    "```\n",
    "returns `1.0` as expected."
